Description:
This game is pretty much the same as the original well-known Flappy bird game released by .GEARS studio in 2013.
Except for the fact that some features are not developed and the pipes might move vertically.

Tool and technologies:
Developed using C++ and SDL2 libraries on Codeblocks IDE

More information:
This was a graded project in the Advanced Programming course in my university.
It took about a week to learn the SDL2 tutorials on lazyfoo's page and to complete this project in Feb 2019, back in the time when I didn't use git.
Lately I found some bug due to false memory deallocations so I debugged and push the project to github in Feb 2020.
